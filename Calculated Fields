								SALESFORCE PIPELINE OPPORTUNITY COHORT ANALYSIS

1. FIND EARLIEST CREATED DATE FOR EACH OPPORTUNITY
	This calculated field will be our vertical axis & Cohort groups
	Convert to Month & Discrete
	
	[First Opportunity Created Date] = DATE( {FIXED [Opportunity ID] : MIN([Created Date])})

2. Calculate the total opportunities that were created in the respective Cohort
	This calculated field creates a fixed amount and is not effected by the Table
	Will be used to calculate % of opportunities closed in x Month

	[Total Closed in Cohort] = TOTAL(COUNTD([Opportunity ID]))

3. Calculate the months between [First Opportunity Created Date] and the [Close Date] for a given [Opportunity ID]
	This expression will be our horizaontal axis, showing us how many opportunities are closed after x Months from the [First Opportunity Created Date]
	Convert to Dimension & Discrete

	[Period] = DATEDIFF ('month', [First Opportunity Created Date], ([Close Date]))

4. Count the Distinct Opportunities that are closed in the respective period. This is different than the Total calculated field in Step 3 because it is not fixed. 
	We want this field changing with the [Period] column
	
	[Opportunities Closed] = COUNTD ([Opportunity ID])

5. Calculate the percent of opportunities closed for a given [Period] by the [Total Closed in Cohort]
	
	[Closed Percent of Total] = [Opportunities Closed] / [Total Closed in Cohort]

							MAIN CALCULATED FIELDS FOR OPP COHORT CLOSED: COUNT

6. Calculate % of Opps Closed in the respective period
	If no opportunities are closed in a given period, and the running sum of previous periods does not equal the total closed in the given cohort, make 0%
	If no opportunities are closed in a given period, and the running sum of previous periods equals the total closed in the given cohort, make NULL

[Opportunity Calculation Count] = IF [Opportunities Closed] <> 0 

    					THEN [Opportunities Closed]
    					ELSE 
    
						IF RUNNING_SUM(COUNTD([Opportunity ID]))<[Total Closed in Cohort]

            						THEN 0
            						ELSE NULL
        					END
				  END

7. Show the [Closed Percent of Total] if it is greater than zero
	If no opportunities are closed in a given period, and the running sum of previous periods does not equal the total closed in the given cohort, make 0%
	If no opportunities are closed in a given period, and the running sum of previous periods equals the total closed in the given cohort, make NULL

[Opportunity Calculation %] = IF [Opportunities Closed] > 0

    				THEN [Closed Percent of Total]
				ELSE

					IF RUNNING_SUM([Opportunities Closed]) < [Total Closed in Cohort]

            					THEN 0
            					ELSE NULL
					END
			      END

8. Calculate the Average % of opportunities closed in a given period
	This needs to be its own Mark, as we need to compute this DOWN, while [Opportunity Calculation Count] is computed ACROSS

[Opportunity Calcualation AVG] = IF ISNULL([Opportunity Calculation %])

    					THEN WINDOW_SUM([Opportunity Calculation Count],FIRST(),0) / WINDOW_SUM([Total Closed in Cohort],FIRST(),0)
					ELSE NULL

				 END
